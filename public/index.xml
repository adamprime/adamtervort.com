      <description>As a gawky high school freshman I was invited to do something really cool and join the high school jazz band. Our school district put freshmen at the junior high, so it was pretty neat to go to the high school a couple of times a week and play music with the upperclassmen. I was the only bass player in the high school system so it didn’t matter that I wasn’t any good; if they wanted a bass player they were stuck with me.</description>

      <description>Over the past 11 months I have served as the president of the board of a small 501(3)c nonprofit in my hometown, the Many Moods Choir and Orchestra. Each Christmas season we perform two free concerts for the community. The orchestra and choir are all volunteers who give up time on during for months worth of Saturdays to rehearse together. (This doesn&amp;rsquo;t include all the personal practice time involved. The music we play is hard!</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Adam. I work on the people side of an awesome tech company, SpiderOak. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short punch list of interesting things about me:
 I grew up in KCMO I lived in Taiwan for 10 years I&amp;rsquo;m fluent in Mandarin My first &amp;ldquo;real job&amp;rdquo; way playing jazz bass around Kansas City My second &amp;ldquo;real job&amp;rdquo; was teaching ESL, both in the US and in Asia Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll grow up and get another &amp;ldquo;real job&amp;rdquo;, but for now I play with computers all day I can&amp;rsquo;t stand most music with lyrics  Unless it&amp;rsquo;s jazz  But definitely not smooth jazz  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t even qualify as music    Aside from being a music snob, I&amp;rsquo;m generally pretty nice  One of the things I most enjoy is sharing what I know.</description>
